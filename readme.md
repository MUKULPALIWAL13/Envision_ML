# Siamese Neural Network for Image Recognition

This project implements a **Siamese Neural Network** to recognize and compare images by learning feature similarity. The architecture is inspired by models used in face verification and one-shot learning.

## üß† Project Overview

- **Objective:** Learn to determine whether two images are from the same class.
- **Architecture:** Shared-weight convolutional embedding network + distance computation + dense output.
- **Framework:** TensorFlow (Keras Functional API)

## üìò Additional Notes

- The model uses **contrastive loss** to learn embeddings that minimize distance for similar pairs and maximize distance for different pairs.
- Distance metrics like **L1 norm** or **L2 norm** can be used to compare feature vectors.
- You can customize the number of convolutional layers and filter sizes in siamese_model.py.
